# Project Brief: LeonoreVault

## The Problem
The pain point i felt is to solve inventory at my own home, the item kept missing, as my family are place it as they wanted and forgot, i tried to make it organized and kept track who has/took the item, when they didn't know where to put there's a lost and found box mechanism.

## The Solution
House Inventory Management System, which can track the item (QR Code, etc), organize the location, storage, category, etc, cross platform (PWA). If this is good enough i will publish this app as commercial app (SaaS).

## Target Users
- Primary: My Family / Household
- Secondary: Other Household / SaaS

## Core Value Proposition
Personalize inventory management systems / warehouse management system like professional SAP WM to keep things more organized

## Initial Feature Ideas
1. Item, Category, Location/Storage CMS
2. Scan QR Code
3. Offline Mode
4. Auth
5. Physical Attachment Google Drive Integration
6. Notification
7. Real-time chat

## Success Criteria
- App are easy to use for all ages, and make things organized

## Constraints
- Timeline: 1 week
- Budget: Free if possible, as low as it can
- Tech preferences: NextJS(FE), ExpressJS(BE), TailwindCSS, Animation & 3D (threejs & framer), Supabase (MongoDB), Firebase (Notification), mention any alternative if possible (e.g NextJS standalone is enough, etc, deployment tools, etc)

## Questions to Research
1. Will this app demanded & useful in the market ?
2. Are this tech stack feasible & not too complex ?
3. Does currently this kind of app exist ?
